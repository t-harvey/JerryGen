The purpose of this test is to exercise the separate-compilation
facilities, both of types defined in other .idl files and of types
defined in different objects in the same .idl file.

Compile each of the separate[1-4].idl files into their own directory,
and then combine them all with separate_demo.c, the main routine for
this test.
