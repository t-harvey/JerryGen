The purpose of this test is to make sure that we catch recursive data
structures and report them correctly.

An example of recursive data structure is: type a has a field of type
b and type b has a field of type a.

To test this, run the following compile command (which should fail) :
 ~/work/generator/generate.js --package=nothing recursive_structs.idl

Expected output:

ERROR: there is a cycle in structure definitions:
    >int1<  is a field of  >int3<
    >int3<  is a field of  >dict3<
    >dict3<  is a field of  >dict2<
    >dict2<  is a field of  >int2<
    >int2<  is a field of  >dict1<
    >dict1<  is a field of  >int1<
