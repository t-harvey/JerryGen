The purpose of this test is to ensure that we correctly handle the
"object" type.  We foresee the object type as an abstraction that gets
passed around but that the C coder probably does not have any
visibility into.

This test, then, creates an interface with a single operation that
takes an object and a callback, and the stub will call the callback
with the object as its parameter.

For the following commands, we assume that the user is in the examples
directory inside the Jerryscript directory, with the generator
directory at the same level in the file hierarchy as Jerryscript.

To compile object_test.idl:
../../generator/generate.js --output_utility_files --package=object_test ../../generator/unit_tests/object_test/object_test.idl

...now, cd into the new object_test directory and copy the stubs file
from the unit_test/object_test directory:
cd object_test/ ; cp ~/work/generator/unit_tests/object_test/call_callback_stubs.c .

Now, run the compile command:
gcc -g --std=c99 -Djerry_value_has_error_flag=jerry_value_is_error -I../../jerry-port/default/include -I../../jerry-core/include -I../../jerry-ext/include -I../../jerry-ext/include/jerryscript-ext/ -I. *.c ../../../generator/unit_tests/template/main_jerrygen.c ../../build/lib/libjerry-core.a ../../build/lib/libjerry-ext.a ../../build/lib/libjerry-port-default.a -lm

...the result should be an a.out executable and no warnings or error
messages.  Run it as follows:
a.out ~/work/generator/unit_tests/object_test/object_test_script.js


The full set of commands:

 ../../generator/generate.js --output_utility_files --package=object_test ../../generator/unit_tests/object_test/object_test.idl && cd object_test/ && cp ~/work/generator/unit_tests/object_test/call_callback_stubs.c . && gcc -g --std=c99 -Djerry_value_has_error_flag=jerry_value_is_error -I../../jerry-port/default/include -I../../jerry-core/include -I../../jerry-ext/include -I../../jerry-ext/include/jerryscript-ext/ -I. *.c ../../../generator/unit_tests/template/main_jerrygen.c ../../build/lib/libjerry-core.a ../../build/lib/libjerry-ext.a ../../build/lib/libjerry-port-default.a -lm && a.out ~/work/generator/unit_tests/object_test/object_test_script.js


Expected output:

undefined
undefined
undefined
x.a = 1     x.b = 2
