The purpose of this test is to exercise the code that checks for any
duplicate names in a webidl file.  The code has multiple dictionaries,
callbacks, and interfaces with duplicate names scattered throughout.

Expected output: the error messages that the parser (really,
AugmentedAST) should produce are:

ERROR: duplicate names in the input file:
