This test is designed to test the infrastructure used to build
array types.  It includes not only building arrays of
combinations of all four WebIDL constructs, but differentiating
between them, so there are many variations that we have to test.

The .idl file defines a couple of types of each WebIDL construct with
minor differences, and the main.c file contains many tests against the
types, both from the Javascript side and the C/API side.

To generate C code:

GENERATOR/generate.js --output_utility_files --debug_printing --package=array_test GENERATOR/unit_tests/array_types/array_types.idl

To compile into Jerryscript (from the
Jerryscript/examples/array_test directory):

gcc -g --std=c99 -I. -I../../jerry-port/default/include/ -I../../jerry-core/include -I../../jerry-ext/include -I../buffer -I../../jerry-main GENERATOR/unit_tests/array_types/array_test_main.c ../buffer/*.c *.c ../../build/lib/libjerry-core.a ../../build/lib/libjerry-ext.a ../../build/lib/libjerry-port-default.a -lm
