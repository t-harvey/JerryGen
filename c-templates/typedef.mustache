{{! to simplify the handling of typedefs' usage, we let all of the
    code that uses some typedefs use the standard calls (like
    "<typedefName>_constructor") as if the type actually existed, and then we
    just make sure that this file gets included -- the alternative
    would be to check every time before we put out a type to see if
    it's a typedef'd type and then put out the other name, which
    complicates our code more than I want to right now... }}
{{! the upshot is that we don't even need to include any other files,
    as all of the rest of the code will take care of their own
    includes... }}
